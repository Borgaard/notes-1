# Sample Lecture (10-15 min)

## Objective
Students will be able to create and run a basic javascript file and interact with the javascript repl through node.

## Link (1-2 min)
Priviously we may have seen some html, css, and maybe a little bit of javascript. As well as played with some text editors.

Today we're going talk a little bit about how to run a javascript file and interact with the javascirpt REPL.


## Educate and Engage (4-5 min)
Go over examples of some of the primitive datatypes in javascript
(https://github.com/Curriculum-Resources/SF-14-Class-12-Sept-Notes/tree/master/week_01_fundamentals/day_3_intro_to_javascript/dawn_js_primitives)
in a file and run that file with the node command.
Alternatively use (https://github.com/Curriculum-Resources/SF-14-Class-10-Notes/tree/master/week_01_programming_fundamentals_with_the_web/day_2_intro_to_js/dawn_js_primatives)

**Fist of Five** for how you're feeling about basic syntax of javascript and how to run a javascript file.

After that open up a REPL and  show that we can interact with javascript through the node REPL.

What is a REPL??
REPL stands for READ-EVAL-PRINT-LOOP. It does exactly what it says, it will read a line of javascript code, evaluate the code that it, all the while looping over that process... (unclear write out better)

**Fist of Five** for how you feel about what a REPL is and how to interact with a javascript REPL.

## Active (2-3 min)
If you're not feeling great about it dont worry. Right now I'm going to have you try it your self.

So everyone open up a node REPL.
I want you to make an array full of strings of the names of everyone here.

talk to your neighbor. check to make sure that they have something similar.

Okay cool, who wants to share??

## Reflect (2-3 min)
So I want you to think about how you would make the same array, and print out the reselts of the array, but rather than doing it through a REPL, do it through a file.

Try to give that a try.

## Now and then (1-2 min)

and next weeek we're going to cover how to make larger javascript files
