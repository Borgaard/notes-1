// This is what a Line Comment looks like

/** I can also write comments this way
 *  see how its just one comment of many different lines?
 *  Comments are text that the javascript will ignore.
 *  They're used just to give us a little bit of context about
 *  whats to come next in the code.

// The var keyword defines a new variable. It's a symbolic representation
// for some type of javascript value.
var x;
var aNewVariable;
// variable names can be any alpha-numeric value that we'd like, with exception
// special keywords that the javascript language reserves.
// for example we couldnt have a variable name named var;

// We have a notion of true and false in javascript.
// True is represented as the keyword true and false
// by the keyword false.
true;
false;

// Numbers are one of the types of values we want to be able to
// interact and play with in JS. They look like this:

var one = 1;
var two = 2;
var three = 3;
var fooooooooouuuuurrrrrrrr = 4;

// Lets play around with numbers in the repl a little bit now.
// Go to command line and run the command node, or open up a browser
// and go to your console.


// Other than numbers we've got these things called strings.
// Strings are just collections of characters.

// We use them to deal with words and text in javascript
// as well as other programming languages

var aString = "This is a string";
var name = "Michael";

// For collections of things we can use arrays, which are just
// an order collection of things in javascript.

var myArray = [1,3,6,2,5];
var anotherOne = ["one", "two", "zero"];

// myArray[0] = 1;
// myArray[1] = 3;
//
// anotherOne[0] = 'one';
// ...

// Another ways to store collectsions is using objects, (called hashes in most other
// languages).

// objects just store a key-value pair, much like the way a dictionary works

var people = { Michael: 24, Del: 25 };

// people["Michael"] = 24;
// people["Del"] = 25;
