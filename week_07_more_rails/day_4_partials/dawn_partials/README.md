# Intro Rails
## Using Partials



| Objectives |
| :---- |
| to DRY up views and repetitive logic into reusable components |
| to identify common areas of repetition in views |
| to organize our view partials by related concerns |


## Refactoring 

We will begin by refactoring our [`rails_blog`](https://github.com/sf-wdi-15/rails_testing.git) from earlier in the week and applying partials aggressively to clean up the code.
