#Functional Programming and Iterators
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs, that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

## Objectives

| Objective |
| :--- |
| Students will be able to describe what is meant by the phrase "First-Class Functions".|
| Students will be able to use higher-order functions to make new functions.|
| Studnets will be able to use common iterators like Map and Reduce. |


##What does that mean? Haven't we already been doing that?

###First class functions

###Higher order functions

###Iterators

####forEach

####map

####reduce

##Examples of my personal favorite functional programming languages
1. Lisp
  a. Scheme
  b. Clojure
  c. Common Lisp
2. Haskell
